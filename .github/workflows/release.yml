            ### Download Options:
            
            **For direct GitHub users (recommended):**

            **For app stores (F-Droid, Play Store, etc.):**
            - Download `app-store-release-unsigned.apk` - No auto-updater (stores handle updates)
            
            ### What's New:
            - Bug fixes and improvements
            - Enhanced notification handling
            - Improved performance
            
            ### Installation:
            1. Download the appropriate APK for your use case
            2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Android settings

            ### Notes:
            - GitHub variant includes auto-update functionality
            - Store variant relies on app store updates
            - Both variants are functionally identical except for update handling
